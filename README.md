# Modified-Word-Puzzle
Designed and implemented an abstract data type (ADT) to solve a modified 2D word search puzzle with wrap-around grid edges and 8-directional word traversal (N, NE, E, SE, S, SW, W, NW).</br>
Key contributions include:</br>
- Built logic to find words in any direction, handling edge-wrapping for seamless row/column transitions.</br>
- Created methods to validate grid structure and check for invalid inputs (e.g., empty words).</br>
- Developed clear functions like findWord() and findAllWords() to simplify user interactions.</br>
- Ensured efficient performance for large grids and reusable code structure.</br>
